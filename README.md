# 🧠 Customer Segmentation for Investment Banking

A machine learning-based customer segmentation project designed for investment banking companies. This project clusters customers based on various demographic and investment-related features to drive personalized marketing and improve client retention.

---

## 📌 Project Objective

To segment investment banking clients using **K-Means clustering** and **RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis**. This enables banks to:

- Identify high-value and at-risk clients
- Offer customized financial services
- Drive strategic customer engagement

---

## 🧾 Dataset

An artificially generated dataset that simulates real-world client profiles with the following fields:

- `client_id`
- `occupation`
- `income_level`
- `investment_tenure`
- `recency`
- `monetary`
- `frequency (annual)`
- `total_investment_value`
- `age`

---

## 🧪 Techniques Used

- 📌 **Standardization** using `StandardScaler`
- 🤖 **K-Means Clustering**
- 📉 **Elbow Method** to determine optimal cluster count
- 🧮 **RFM Analysis** (Recency, Frequency, Monetary)
- 📊 **2D & 3D Visualizations** (Seaborn, Plotly)

---

## ⚙️ Tech Stack

- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Seaborn, Matplotlib, Plotly
